I woke up at the first light of 2015 on my bus window somewhere near Shitakunda. On my left i could see the outlines of hills covered in fog. I tried to look at my wristwatch to see the time. Inside I was in a lost situation. This road, the hills on my left, the light, the motion of the bus - all too familiar to me. I have been on this road many times. But every time, somewhere on the highway where there is no sign saying the name of the location makes me feel lost.
