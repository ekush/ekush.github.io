If you ask me what could your best 2015 resolution be, the youth leadership bootcamp will definitely be on top of my suggestions. Definitely geting the chance there is not going to be easy, but you can stay assured you will not get the same experiecne in any other leadership facilitating programs.

BYLC continuously is facilitating leadership among our youth from its beginning. Each of the programs they arrange are unique on their own
