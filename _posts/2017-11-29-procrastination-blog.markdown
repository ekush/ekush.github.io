<p>I knew exactly what was I doing on my third episode of the 'new' series on Netflix which I didnt even want to watch.
I had plenty of things pending on my to-do list. There are at least three new courses I started during last 2 weeks which I haven't really moved
past the first two lessons. My room is a mess and I skipped office just to catch up on all my backlogs while being in the comfort of my own study while being
surrounded by my cats in front of the humming of my aquarium. </p>

<p>The plan was perfect so far. Except I discovered myself on my bed at 12:47pm and I still didn't have my breakfast yet, I don't have any idea about what lucnh I am going to have
and above everything the pack of cigarette is almost empty and I dont want to go out with my headache which I don't know came from where.
In my mind I could clearly see where the day is heading.</p>

<blockquote>Inspiration is for amateurs - the rest of us just show up and get to work. </blockquote>
<p>This was my favorite quote for a long time. I tried and did show up at work. Did what I needed to do - well for the most part of it. I couldn't really complain about anything. I have the job that I wanted.
I have an amazing group of colleagues who became friends and sometimes more that just friends. I was having all the fun. But among all of these, I gradually started to fell less and less inspired everyday.
I don't really know what have changed. I clearly could see I am working with less than 30% of my efficiency. I don't feel like going to the office the morning I wake up. Even the idea of going to work makes me depressed while
I clearly know the thing I am going to work on at my office was one of my favorite things to do. And no matter what I was doing, I couldn't put my mind to it. This sucks in all imaginable was possible, but I don't know what to do.</p>

<p>And then here I am. Lost. Very lost. I don't really know what to do. This has become so unbearable that I am losing hope on myself.</p>

<h3>To solve a problem....</h3>

<p>It takes a lot of things to solve a problem. Probably the first approach to any problem solving is to understand the problem itself. I think in my case I have admitted that I have a problem and that takes me one step closer to solving the
problem. Now, since that I know I have a problem, the ideal next step is to understand the problem. To do this, I fell back to this blog here. You may ask, why? The answer is, as much as I like the modern and sleek nature of Medium, or the familiar
back end of WordPress, in reality, there are lots of elements of distractions are there to happen. For this blog though, it's a bit different. I write this mostly from my text editor or the IDE of my choice. And I push the blog using git.
These reduces the glance of a lot of shiny things from in front of me.</p>

<p>The chance of getting lost in the way to research is always there. But to be honest, I don't really want to research anything on this. All I want to do is to commit myself to list of things I did while I was procrastinating. I don't yet have a clear idea of how I am going to
keep track of those things. But I will try my best to do so.</p>

<p>To begin whit, today was very easy. I skipped office today. So most of the day I was on my bed. I watched 6 episodes of tv series on Netflix, none of them I liked.
I watched 3 episodes of tutorials on Jekyll. Again, I don't really think I am very much interested in that. I read about TDD. Tried mindlessly copy pasting codes from a book
and learn the concepts of TDD, while not really paying any attention. I spent 40 minutes thinking about how I am going to finish the piles of work that are due. And then went back to
take a nap. And finally I started writing this. This is also a part of my procrastination.</p>

<p>And finally, I don't really know where I am trying to go with this. Well, to be honest I dont really want to go anywhere with this.</p>
