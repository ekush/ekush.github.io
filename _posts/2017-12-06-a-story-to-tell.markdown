Every creative attempt to solve a real world problem using technology involves
a lot of sacrifice often never told of. We all know how successful a product has became
after it gets popular, and famous. But often the back stories are never told.

When a business team or a communications team represents a product, they
often forget about the struggles which went behind the development of that magic.
Partially it is the fault of the developers who fails to communicate their struggles,
or partially it is because developers are mostly seen as machines who turns
caffeine into tools that work.

Struggling for a project comes in many forms. It starts at the corner cubicle of the quiet office
and gradually spreads through the lives of the workers of the trade. It can be as little as
struggling with a few lines of codes. It could be as big as being unmindful and making disasters in
the code. But nonetheless the stories of struggles are never the favorite ones in the market.

Often the struggle starts with the mismatch of the understanding of abilities from the perspective of the developer.
We tend to overestimate our capacities very easily. We think a task will take two hours, because in our head we don't
consider a lot of other things beside optimal coding or making stuff. There are thinking involved. There are lots of trial and errors, there
are lots of testing, making silly mistakes on the very trivial things. THere are embarrassing google searches involved.
And for all we know, we never really take these into consideration.

Struggle also comes from the business side of the scenario. Often deadlines are put together
based on what the business wants rather than what realistically possible within that time frame and developer being developers
we agree to unrealistic goals often because we take pride in delivering more than what was thought to be possible earlier.
The thrill of crossing boundaries takes us so far that we tend to forget about the consequences of that ride.

Finally our life start to fall behind. Our to-do list keeps piling up. Deadlines become more and more difficult to meet.
we miss dinners, we miss dates, we miss hangouts, we miss a lot of our lives while we blankly stare at a dark monitor
and our fingers write mostly mediocre codes.
