To give a context to all of these, in this recent lock down and work from home situation, I have decided to finally upgrade my computer.
I pretty much had an idea and budget in my mind, and I finally started getting the components I wanted.

One of the improvement of my desk setup is a mechanical keyboard from gigabyte (I know, may be not the best, but I had to choose within a budget).

After getting the keyboard I definitely started to enjoy typing a lot more than I used to. 
At the same time I wanted to challenge myself to learn touch typing.

The challenge here is to unlearn the way I type, and learn to type properly and faster.

The problem:

The way I type is something in between of touch typing and looking-at-the-keyboard and praying I am typing correctly typing.
i can type at a decent speed for now, but this is not the easiest on my neck and eyes. I have to continuously switch between looking at the computer screen and the keyboard. This creates a lot of extra stress. 

The solution:
Learn touch typing. The fact that you can just look at the monitor or where ever you want and type your way away is quite cool. This also reduces a lot of physical stress.

So here goes my journey. 

Day one:

As usual, I have started with searching for a training video on youtube. I have then watched some of them. And the decided I will give one of the online typing tool a bit of a try.

The website I have decided to practice and learn my typing is <a href="https://www.keybr.com/">keybr</a>. 

Here it how it is going so far.

Day one :

I am terrible. usually i can type somewhere between 40-50 wpm with the typing tool I am typing at 7.8 words per average. I am facing a lot of problems and my confidence level (how confident I to type a letter) is just 0. This already seems like a hopeless attempt.
Nevertheless I think I will just have to keep trying this for a while till I get better.
