This is some sort of honest assessment of my learning process. I don't know if anyone should care about this or not, but I am still writing this as a not to myself.

In the process of learning, I tend to go too deep almost all the time. Whenever I find a new interesting topic, I invest endless hours of my time going through all the research I could find online. Now this helps me understand the topic better. At the same time, what I don't realise is the sheer volume of time I am investing on these somewhat knowledge endevour are the time I could actually implement some of the things I have already learned.
Now, for me, knowing stuff is sort an escape from realitly. I need stuff to keep my mind busy, and this  is agreat way to do that. On the other hand, I am somewhat a perfectionist and shy person. This makes it extremely difficult for me to put anything up which is not perfect, at least not in my eyes.

Now, a lot of friends, colleagues, and supervisors over the time has adviced me to shift from this mentality, but for some reason I still cannot gather enough courage to do so. For now, this still remains as my escape from the fact that I cannot tolerate my imperfection. 

I don't know if this endless rabbit thole of youtube videos or tutorials is ever going to end. But this is my comfort zone. I hide behind these.
